# can you figure out the logic here?

ay = "a"
bee = "b"

# which one is bigger?

print(ay > bee)

# why??
print(ord(ay))
print(ord(bee))
# here is a hint: check out the ord() function
# How does python store string characters under the hood?
# # look up what ord() does online and report back!
# --> The ord() function returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified character.
